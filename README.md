# OkCupid-Date-A-Scientist

The **goal** of this project is to practice formulating questions and implementing Machine Learning techniques to answer those questions, potentially using NLP (Natural Language Processing), Supervised and Unsupervised ML.

The **data** is from OKCupid, an app that focuses on using multiple choice and short answers to match users. It was provided by <a href='https://www.codecademy.com/'>Codecademy</a> for the final project in the Machine Learning portion of the Data Scientist career path, in `profiles.csv`.

What **analysis** will we perform to acheive the project goals? 

- We can explore and visualize the data - What type of person uses OKCupid and how are they able to describe themselves within the parameters of the site?

- Can we use Machine Learning to fill in missing data? If we were using a dating app, what information about potential partners would be most important personally?  I might have allergies, or really love animals, and want to know if they had pets. 

We can wrap up by **evaluating** how well the model performed - Does it indicate we can answer the question(s) with any confidence?
